### MultiLiteralArgument and LiteralArgument changes

In previous versions, the ability has been introduced to access arguments by their node names. However, while this was possible for every other argument, it wasn't possible for `MultiLiteralArgument`s. This was now changed because the values from the `MultiLiteralArgument` are included in the [`CommandArguments`](../create-commands/arguments/command-arguments) of a command.

Therefore, the current constructor has been deprecated and the new one should be used:

```java
withArguments(new MultiLiteralArgument("survival", "creative", "adventure", "spectator")) // [!code --]

withArguments(new MultiLiteralArgument("gamemodes", List.of("survival", "creative", "adventure", "spectator"))) // [!code ++]
```


Because it is possible to list `LiteralArgument`s in the [`CommandArguments`](../create-commands/arguments/command-arguments) of a command, there was also an additional constructor added to the `LiteralArgument` class. The other one is not deprecated.

Now, the `LiteralArgument` class contains two possible constructors:

```java
public LiteralArgument(String literal) // Recommended if the literal is not listed
public LiteralArgument(String nodeName, String literal)
```
