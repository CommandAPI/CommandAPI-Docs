# Configuration for server admins

The CommandAPI has a few configuration options to change how it functions. These options can be set in the `plugins/CommandAPI/config.yml` file, which is generated automatically when the CommandAPI runs for the first time.

<script setup>
import ConfigViewer from "../../.vitepress/theme/components/ConfigViewer.vue";
import { data } from "../../.vitepress/config-spec/en.data.mts";
</script>
